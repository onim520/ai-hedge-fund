#Automated AI Hedge Fund with UX  

This is a forked version of the stellar project from viratt located at https://github.com/virattt/ai-hedge-fund.  I forked it as I wanted to build some customization and a UX for it, as well as improve some of the trading capabilities, hence the fork.  Please take any ideas from here and include in your builds if you like, but his project is the source for the agentic models - go support him

An AI-powered hedge fund that uses multiple agents to make trading decisions with an argumentitive chat room you can engage with. The system employs several specialized agents working together:

1. Market Data Agent - Gathers and preprocesses market data
2. Quantitative Agent - Analyzes technical indicators and generates trading signals
3. Risk Management Agent - Evaluates portfolio risk and sets position limits
4. Portfolio Management Agent - Makes final trading decisions and generates orders

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Operating System: Windows 10/11 (64-bit)
- Python: Version 3.10 or higher
- Minimum Hardware:
  - 16GB RAM recommended
  - 50GB free disk space
  - Administrative privileges for installation

### Required Software
- Python 3.10+ (64-bit)
- Git
- Windows PowerShell or Command Prompt with administrative privileges

## Installation Guide

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heyross/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

### 2. Installation Methods

#### Option A: Automated Installation (Recommended)
Run the installation script with administrative privileges:
```bash
cd scripts
install.bat
```

#### Option B: Manual Installation
1. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installation Checks
The installation script performs the following checks:
- Verifies administrative privileges
- Checks Python installation and version
- Creates a virtual environment
- Installs core dependencies
- Sets up data science packages
- Configures API and AI packages

### Troubleshooting
- Ensure you have administrative rights
- Verify Python 3.10+ is installed and in PATH
- Check `pip_install.log` and `install_script.log` for detailed error messages

### Post-Installation Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in required API keys:
   - OpenAI API Key
   - Alpaca Trading API Keys
   - Other necessary credentials

## Verification
After installation, you can verify the setup by running:
```bash
python src/agents.py --check-setup
```

## Common Issues
- **Python Not Found**: Ensure Python 3.10+ is installed and added to PATH
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Use the provided `requirements.txt`
- **Permission Errors**: Run installation script as Administrator

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hey_r/ai-hedge-fund.git
   cd ai-hedge-fund
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   # Copy example environment file
   cp .env.example .env
   
   # Edit .env with your API keys
   # Required keys:
   # - OPENAI_API_KEY
   # - FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY
   ```

4. Local Development:
   ```bash
   # Activate virtual environment
   poetry shell
   
   # Run the application
   python src/agents.py
   ```

5. Docker Development:
   ```bash
   # Build the Docker image
   docker build -t ai-hedge-fund .
   
   # Run with Docker Compose
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hey_r/ai-hedge-fund.git
cd ai-hedge-fund
```

1. Install Poetry (if not already installed):
```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
poetry install
```

3. Set up your environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
export FINANCIAL_DATASETS_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
```

## Usage

### Running the Hedge Fund

```bash
poetry run python src/agents.py --ticker AAPL
```

**Example Output:**
```json
{
  "action": "buy",
  "quantity": 50000,
}
```

You can optionally specify the start and end dates to make decisions for a specific time period.

```bash
poetry run python src/agents.py --ticker AAPL --start-date 2024-01-01 --end-date 2024-03-01
```

### Running the Hedge Fund (with Reasoning)
This will print the reasoning of each agent to the console.

```bash
poetry run python src/agents.py --ticker AAPL --show-reasoning
```

**Example Output:**
```
==========         Quant Agent          ==========
{
  "signal": "bearish",
  "confidence": 0.5,
  "reasoning": {
    "MACD": {
      "signal": "neutral",
      "details": "MACD Line crossed neither above nor below Signal Line"
    },
    "RSI": {
      "signal": "bearish",
      "details": "RSI is 72.07 (overbought)"
    },
    "Bollinger": {
      "signal": "bearish",
      "details": "Price is above upper band"
    },
    "OBV": {
      "signal": "bullish",
      "details": "OBV slope is 30612582.00 (bullish)"
    }
  }
}
========================================

==========    Risk Management Agent     ==========
{
  "max_position_size": 10000.0,
  "risk_score": 6,
  "trading_action": "hold",
  "reasoning": "The overall signal is bearish with moderate confidence, indicated by overbought RSI and price above the Bollinger band, suggesting potential downside. However, the bullish OBV could offset some bearish pressure. Therefore, it's prudent to hold off on new positions until clearer direction emerges."
}
========================================

==========  Portfolio Management Agent  ==========
{
  "action": "hold",
  "quantity": 0,
  "reasoning": "The team's analysis indicates a bearish outlook with moderate confidence due to overbought RSI and price above the Bollinger band, while the bullish OBV suggests some counterbalancing. The risk management team recommends holding off on new positions until clearer direction emerges. Additionally, the current portfolio has no shares to sell, and the risk profile advises against new purchases."
}
========================================
```

### Running the Backtester

```bash
poetry run python src/backtester.py --ticker AAPL
```

**Example Output:**
```
